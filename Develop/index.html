We did this because technically there are only TWO "main"  "sections" of content, and so as to affected the entirety of each one, and then the individual articles "underneath" it instead of just individually named with div and then referenced back in the css with the same div selector. So we didnt have to repeat ourselves so much which is super important value in coding!!-->

                <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
                <p>
                    The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see
                    when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
